# Data Structure Visualizer

**Data Structure Visualizer** is an innovative web-based tool designed to help students, educators, and professionals understand and interact with data structures in a dynamic and visually engaging way. This project aims to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application by providing a hands-on approach to learning complex data structures.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Visualization**
  - Real-time visual representations of various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
  - Animations for each operation (insertion, deletion, search, etc.), making it easier to comprehend the underlying processes.

- **Code Integration**
  - Write and execute code that directly affects the visualized data structures.
  - Step through code line by line to see how each operation modifies the data structure.

- **Educational Resources**
  - Built-in tutorials and examples to guide users through different data structures and their operations.
  - Explanatory notes and tips to enhance understanding and learning.

- **Customizable Experience**
  - Customize the visual appearance of the data structures to suit your preferences.
  - Supports various themes and color schemes for a comfortable and personalized user experience.

- **Collaborative Learning**
  - Share work with peers or instructors for collaborative learning and feedback.
  - Planned integration with popular learning management systems and collaboration platforms.

- **Real-World Applications**
  - Includes scenarios and problems that mimic real-world applications to show the practical utility of different data structures.
  - Experiment with different approaches to solve these problems and see the outcomes.
